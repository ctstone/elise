    <p><b>Mission</b></p>
</div>
 
<p>Amory Fitness seeks to empower Bostonians to live longer, stronger and healthier lives through fitness education, advocacy work, and physical training. We believe that not all fitness goals have to be achieved in a gym. We work daily with individuals and non-profit organizations to integrate Boston's communal green spaces with our clients' health and fitness goals.</p>
<p>As a continued part of this effort, Amory Fitness supports public policies that engage the concept of "livable streets". We believe that the safety of cyclists, runners and pedestrians is essential to achieving a healthy and fit community. Through our public and private partners, we seek to establish Boston as a world class cycling community--one that will attract the next generation of health-conscious, innovation-minded individuals who will drive the local economy.</p>
<p>This combination of structured fitness programs with community engagement sets Amory Fitness apart from the everyday world of gym fitness.</p>
