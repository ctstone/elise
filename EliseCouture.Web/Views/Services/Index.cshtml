    <div class="span8">
        <p>Maybe you already belong to a gym and you work out; perhaps you work out A LOT. You eat healthy, but you feel that your weight-loss goals have plateaued and not much is changing. The combination of personalized training and nutritional support can help you break through that barrier and finally meet your weight-loss goals and make you feel comfortable in your own skin.</p>

        <h3>Program Design & Consultation</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
        <p>Do you travel frequently? No time for one-on-one sessions? If your only regular fitness opportunity is at the hotel or office gym, a program consultation can help get you back on track. After doing an initial assessment, and looking at your goals, we can create a periodized fitness plan that enables you to work up to your desired fitness level on your own time, wherever you may be.</p>

        <h3>Corrective Fitness</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
        <p>If you are returning to fitness training following an injury or if you just want to correct an awkward compensation, Amory Fitness can help you achieve this goal. After being cleared for regular exercise by your physician or physical therapist, we can work together to develop a personalized training program that bridges the gap between physical therapy and getting you back to your regularly active lifestyle.  Just because you suffered an injury, doesn’t mean you can’t achieve your goals.</p>
